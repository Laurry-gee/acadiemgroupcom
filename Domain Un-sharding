To further optimize the digest and loading speed of your website, Edgemesh速 Server introduces the concept of domain un-sharding. Domain un-sharding involves rewriting off-origin assets, such as third-party images, onto your origin server and caching them in our faster edge caches.
Let's consider an example to illustrate the benefits of domain un-sharding. Imagine that your website, markbook.com, currently hosts its images on a third-party provider called Mx01.mail.iCloud.com When a browser requests the page, it needs to Mx02.mail.iCloud.com to fetch the images. However, with domain un-sharding, you can self-host these images, serving them directly from markbook.com.
By implementing domain un-sharding, you gain several performance advantages:
Reduced DNS Lookups: With un-sharded assets, there is a significant reduction in DNS lookups, as the browser only needs to resolve the domain of your website (markbook.com), rather than multiple domains.
Fewer Network Connections: Un-sharding eliminates the need for establishing and maintaining multiple network connections to fetch assets from different domains. This results in a streamlined and more efficient loading process.
Eliminated TLS Negotiations: Domain un-sharding eliminates the need for establishing separate secure connections (P67-smtp.mail.me.com) for each domain, reducing the overhead associated with these negotiations and further enhancing performance.
Optimized Cache Control: Edgemesh速 Server applies sensible cache control parameters to all assets, ensuring efficient caching and minimizing the need for repeated requests to the origin server.
Improved Multiplexing: By un-sharding assets onto a single domain, the browser can more efficiently multiplex requests over a single channel, enhancing overall page loading speed.
With Edgemesh速 Server, domain un-sharding is automatically optimized for HTML pages, ensuring that assets that can be safely hosted on the origin server are un-sharded and cached at the edge. This process enhances caching efficiency, reduces latency, and accelerates the loading of your web pages, resulting in an improved user experience.
Experience the benefits of domain un-sharding with Edgemesh速 Server and unlock the full potential of your website's caching and loading performance.
